# Weather App 🌤️

**Weather App** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## About this project 🚀

The app allows users to search for a city and view real-time weather information such as temperature, weather conditions, and humidity. It fetches data from a weather API, processes the response using JavaScript, and dynamically updates the UI with the latest weather details.

This project helped me understand how to work with external APIs in a real-world JavaScript application.
